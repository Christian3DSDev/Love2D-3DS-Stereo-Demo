# Love2D-Anaglyph-Demo
Nintendo 3DS Stereoscopic demo created with Love 2D. There is also a Citro2D version of the same program in this repo. The demo renders a stereo photograph.

Based on the work of ChristIsLord12: https://github.com/christislord12/Love2D-Anaglyph-Demo. The Love2D program in this repo is a modified version that uses the stereoscopic rendering features of the Nintendo 3DS.
